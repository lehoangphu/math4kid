### 1. **Repetition with Ordering**
This is the easiest type of problem. You are choosing items **with repetition allowed** (you can pick the same item more than once) and **the order matters** (which item comes first or second is important).

#### Formula:
If you have \( n \) options and you are choosing \( r \) items, the total number of ways is \( n^r \).

#### Example:
Let’s say you’re making a 3-digit security code, and you can choose any digit (0 to 9) for each position. How many different codes can you make?

You have 10 choices (0 to 9) for each digit, and you are choosing 3 digits:
\[
10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000 \text{ possible codes}
\]
